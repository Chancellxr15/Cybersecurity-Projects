This repository documents my hands-on work and continuous learning in cybersecurity, with a strong focus on:

### ☁️ Cloud Security
- Securing cloud environments (AWS / Azure concepts)
- Identity and Access Management (IAM)
- Monitoring, logging, and incident detection
- Hardening cloud infrastructure against misconfigurations and threats

### 🦠 Malware Analysis
- Static and dynamic malware analysis
- Understanding attacker techniques and payload behavior
- Reverse engineering fundamentals
- Identifying indicators of compromise (IOCs)

### 🛡️ Defensive Security
- Threat detection and response
- Network and endpoint security
- Security monitoring and log analysis
- Applying defense-in-depth principles

The goal of this repo is to bridge theory with real-world security practice, strengthen defensive skills, and build a solid foundation for roles in SOC, Cloud Security, and Blue Team operations.
